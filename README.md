# About 
This product focuses on delivering powerful and robust data intergrity solution to its clients and there clients, maintaing a highly secure
chain of  transactional data between the businesses and its recipient.
Data integrity can be compromised in several ways. Each time data is replicated or transferred, it should remain intact and unaltered between updates. Error checking methods and validation procedures are typically relied on to ensure the integrity of data that is transferred or reproduced without the intention of alteration.
Therefore our product uses fundamental principles of blockchain to evalute hash functions , which are chained in order to create a well connected 
transactional database.
